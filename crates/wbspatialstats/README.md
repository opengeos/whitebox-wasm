## Mission

- Provide robust spatial statistics and geostatistics capabilities for Whitebox applications and workflows.
- Implement kriging variants, variogram estimation/fitting, spatial autocorrelation measures, spatial regression, and point-process analysis in pure Rust.
- Support production-grade spatial inference with proper diagnostics, cross-validation, and uncertainty quantification.
- Prioritize numerical stability and performance while maintaining minimal external dependencies.

## The Whitebox Project

[Whitebox](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com) is a suite of open-source geospatial data analysis software with roots at the [University of Guelph](https://geg.uoguelph.ca), Canada, where [Dr. John Lindsay](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html) began the project in 2009. Over more than fifteen years it has grown into a widely used platform for geomorphometry, spatial hydrology, LiDAR processing, and remote sensing research. In 2021 Dr. Lindsay and Anthony Francioni founded [Whitebox Geospatial Inc.](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com) to ensure the project's long-term, sustainable development. **Whitebox Next Gen** is the current major iteration of that work, and this crate is part of that larger effort.

Whitebox Next Gen is a ground-up redesign that improves on its predecessor in nearly every dimension:

- **CRS & reprojection** — Full read/write of coordinate reference system metadata across raster, vector, and LiDAR data, with multiple resampling methods for raster reprojection.
- **Raster I/O** — More robust GeoTIFF handling (including Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs), plus newly supported formats such as GeoPackage Raster and JPEG2000.
- **Vector I/O** — Expanded from Esri Shapefile-only to 11 formats, including GeoPackage, FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet, and other modern interchange formats.
- **Vector topology** — A new, dedicated topology engine (`wbtopology`) enabling robust overlay, buffering, and related operations.
- **LiDAR I/O** — Full support for LAS 1.0–1.5, LAZ, COPC, E57, and PLY via `wblidar`, a high-performance, modern LiDAR I/O engine.
- **Spatial Statistics** — A comprehensive spatial statistics engine (`wbspatialstats`) with kriging, variography, autocorrelation, regression, and point-process tools.
- **Frontends** — Whitebox Workflows for Python (WbW-Python), Whitebox Workflows for R (WbW-R), and a QGIS 4-compliant plugin are in active development.

## Is wbspatialstats Only for Whitebox?

No. `wbspatialstats` is developed primarily to support Whitebox, but it is not restricted to Whitebox projects.

- **Whitebox-first**: API and roadmap decisions prioritize Whitebox geospatial analysis needs.
- **General-purpose**: the crate is usable as a standalone spatial statistics library in other Rust geospatial applications.
- **Production-ready**: proper error handling, numerical stability checks, and comprehensive test coverage make it suitable for production workflows.

## What wbspatialstats Is Not

`wbspatialstats` is a spatial statistics computation engine. It is **not** a full statistics framework.

- Not a format I/O library (file reading/writing belongs in `wbraster` and `wbvector`).
- Not a rendering or visualization engine.
- Not a coordinate reference system engine (CRS and projection belong in `wbprojection`).
- Not a full statistical modeling framework (Bayesian inference, advanced model selection, simulation methods are beyond current scope).
- Not a spatial database (point storage and management is the caller's responsibility).

## Design Goals

- Pure Rust only with no unsafe code in core algorithms.
- Keep dependencies minimal; only use `nalgebra` for linear algebra and `thiserror` for error handling.
- Prioritize numerical stability with appropriate scaling, regularization, and stability checks.
- Support both synchronous batch-mode computation and single-prediction workflows.
- Interoperability with `wbraster` and `wbvector` via coordinate/value tuples and standard Rust collections.

        (0.0, 0.0),
        (1.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 1.0),
        (1.0, 1.0),
    ];
    let primary_values = vec![10.0, 12.0, 11.0, 13.0];

    // Create variogram model
    let vgm = VariogramModel::exponential(
        1.0,    // range parameter
        1.0,    // sill (total variance)
        0.1,    // nugget
        "z",    // variable name
    );

    // Initialize kriging predictor
    let kriging = OrdinaryKriging::new(
        &vgm,
        &primary_coords,
        &primary_values,
        16,  // neighborhood size
    )?;

    // Predict at a new location
    let prediction = kriging.predict((0.5, 0.5))?;
    println!("Predicted value: {}", prediction.value);
    println!("Kriging variance: {}", prediction.variance);
    println!("Kriging std error: {}", prediction.variance.sqrt());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Empirical Variogram Example

```rust
use wbspatialstats::variogram::EmpiricalVariogramBuilder;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Sample data
    let coords = vec![
        (0.0, 0.0),
        (1.0, 0.0),
        (0.0, 1.0),
        (1.0, 1.0),
    ];
    let values = vec![10.0, 12.0, 11.0, 13.0];

    // Build empirical variogram
    let builder = EmpiricalVariogramBuilder::new(&coords, &values);
    let vgm = builder
        .with_max_distance(2.0)
        .with_bin_size(0.5)
        .build()?;

    println!("Empirical variogram: {} lags", vgm.lags.len());
    for lag in &vgm.lags {
        println!("  Distance: {:.2}, Semi-variance: {:.2}", lag.distance, lag.semi_variance);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

use wbspatialstats::weights::SpatialWeightsGraph;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Sample data
    let values = vec![10.0, 12.0, 11.0, 13.0];
    
    // Create spatial weights (inverse distance)
    let weights = SpatialWeightsGraph::inverse_distance(
        &[(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0)],
        1.0,  // exponent
    )?;

    // Compute Moran's I
    let morans_i = GlobalMoransI::new(&weights, &values)?;
    println!("Moran's I: {:.4}", morans_i.statistic);
    println!("Expected I (under null): {:.6}", morans_i.expected);

## Examples

See [examples/](examples/) directory for additional worked examples:

- `kriging_workflow.rs` — End-to-end kriging pipeline with variogram fitting
- `spatial_autocorrelation.rs` — Computing and interpreting Moran's I and LISA
- `gwr_local_regression.rs` — Geographically weighted regression with local coefficients
- `point_process.rs` — Ripley's K analysis and envelope testing

## Known Limitations

1. **Kriging**:
   - Ordinary kriging assumes stationarity; non-stationary processes may need trend removal first.
   - Large datasets (>5000 points) may require local kriging or neighborhood selection for performance.
   - Anisotropy support is integrated via directional variogram analysis and anisotropy transformation; arbitrary geometric anisotropy tensors are not yet supported.
   - CoKriging supports arbitrary number of auxiliary variables but limited to pairwise cross-variogram relationships.

2. **Variography**:
   - Nested (multi-structure) variograms are partially supported; some complex nesting patterns may require post-hoc model fitting.
   - Cross-variograms are supported but currently limited to primary-auxiliary variable pairs.
   - Directional variogram analysis uses azimuthal binning; tolerance-based directional windows are configurable.

3. **Spatial Regression**:
   - Bayesian spatial models (MCMC, Gibbs sampling) are not yet implemented.
   - Spatial quantile regression is not yet implemented.
   - Robust M-estimation variants are not yet integrated into regression solvers.

4. **Point Process**:
   - Marked point patterns are supported but multitype/multivariate patterns have limited statistical support.
   - 3D/4D point patterns are not yet implemented.

5. **Numerical**:
   - Matrix condition number warnings are logged but not enforced; ill-conditioned systems may silently produce unreliable results.
   - No preconditioning support for very large matrices.
